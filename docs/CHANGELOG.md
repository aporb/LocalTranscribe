## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.0 to 2.0

**Old workflow:**
```bash
cd scripts
python3 diarization.py
python3 transcription.py
python3 combine.py
```

**New workflow:**
```bash
# One command does everything
localtranscribe process audio.mp3

# Or with options
localtranscribe process audio.mp3 --model small --speakers 2
```

**Migration steps:**

1. **Install v2.0:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .  # From project root
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   localtranscribe doctor
   ```

3. **Test with your files:**
   ```bash
   localtranscribe process your-audio.mp3
   ```

**What stays the same:**
- HuggingFace token still required
- Same models and quality
- Same output formats
- Same system requirements

**What changed:**
- Command-line interface (much simpler!)
- No more manual script execution
- Better error messages
- Automatic path handling
