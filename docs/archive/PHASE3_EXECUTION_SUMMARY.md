## 📊 Current State Assessment

### Strengths ✅
- **80% modular already**: Core logic separated from CLI
- **2,050+ lines of production code**: Well-structured
- **Phase 2 complete**: All 6 tasks implemented and working
- **pyproject.toml ready**: Already configured for packaging
- **Rich error handling**: Custom exceptions with context

### Gaps ❌ (Phase 3 Will Address)
- **No test suite**: 0% coverage currently
- **No SDK/API layer**: Can't be used programmatically
- **Monolithic CLI**: 655 lines in single file
- **Not on PyPI**: Installation requires git clone
- **Limited docs**: No API reference or contributor guide

### Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK**: Core refactor (80% done already)
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Test suite (need fixtures)
- **MEDIUM RISK**: SDK design (new API surface)
- **LOW RISK**: PyPI packaging (config ready)

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### 1. Modular CLI Structure

**Current:**
```
localtranscribe/
└── cli.py (655 lines - all commands)
```

**After Phase 3:**
```
localtranscribe/
└── cli/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── main.py           # Entry point
    └── commands/
        ├── process.py    # ~100 lines
        ├── batch.py
        ├── doctor.py
        ├── config.py
        ├── label.py
        └── version.py
```

**Benefit:** Each command is self-contained, easier to maintain

---

### 2. Public API Exposure

**File: `localtranscribe/__init__.py`**
```python
"""LocalTranscribe - Offline audio transcription"""

__version__ = "2.0.0"

# Core functions
from .core.diarization import run_diarization, DiarizationResult
from .core.transcription import run_transcription, TranscriptionResult
from .core.combination import combine_results, CombinationResult

# Pipeline
from .pipeline.orchestrator import PipelineOrchestrator, PipelineResult

# SDK (new in Phase 3)
from .api.client import LocalTranscribe
from .api.types import ProcessResult, BatchResult, Segment

__all__ = [
    "run_diarization",
    "run_transcription",
    "combine_results",
    "PipelineOrchestrator",
    "LocalTranscribe",
    "ProcessResult",
    # ... all public exports
]
```

**Benefit:** Clean imports for developers

---

### 3. Python SDK API

**Usage Example:**
```python
from localtranscribe import LocalTranscribe

# Initialize with defaults
lt = LocalTranscribe(
    model_size="base",
    num_speakers=2,
    output_dir="./transcripts"
)

# Process single file
result = lt.process("meeting.mp3")
print(f"Speakers: {result.num_speakers}")
print(f"Processing time: {result.processing_time:.1f}s")
print(result.transcript)

# Access segments
for segment in result.segments:
    print(f"[{segment.speaker}] {segment.text}")

# Batch processing
results = lt.process_batch(
    "./audio_files/",
    max_workers=4,
    skip_existing=True
)
print(f"Success: {results.successful}/{results.total}")
```

**Benefit:** Pythonic, intuitive API for developers

---

### 4. Test Structure

```
tests/
├── conftest.py              # Shared fixtures
├── generate_fixtures.py     # Create test audio
├── fixtures/
│   ├── audio/
│   │   ├── sample_mono.wav
│   │   ├── sample_stereo.mp3
│   │   └── sample_short.ogg
│   └── expected/
│       └── sample_results.json
├── unit/                    # Fast tests (<1s each)
│   ├── test_diarization.py
│   ├── test_transcription.py
│   ├── test_config.py
│   └── test_path_resolver.py
├── integration/             # Slower e2e tests
│   ├── test_pipeline.py
│   ├── test_cli.py
│   └── test_batch.py
└── test_sdk.py
```

**Benefit:** Fast feedback loop, comprehensive coverage
